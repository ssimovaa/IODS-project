My name is Susanna. I'm a doctoral student in the Faculty of Agriculture and Forestry, UH. I work with plants in the field, molecules in the lab, and data on the computer.

I love digging into data, and would love to *excel* at it. For years, I've wanted to properly learn R but didn't ~~find~~ take the time to do it. Similarly, I've been curious about GitHub, just maybe not quite curious enough to actually try it out. When I got an email from YEB doctoral school about this course, I saw the perfect opportunity to get introduced with R and Git, yet keeping the focus on application -- statistics -- rather than coding.

Right now I'm of two minds about IODS.  There's a lot going on in my research project at the moment, so this course may be just a little too demanding for me.
