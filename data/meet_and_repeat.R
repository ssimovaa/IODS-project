# Data wrangling - RStudio exercixe 6 / IODS

# BPRS data originates from Davis, C. S. (2002). Statistical Methods 
# for the Analysis of Repeated Measurements. Springer, New York.

# 40 male subjects were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups 
# and each subject was rated on the brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS) 
# measured before treatment began (week 0) and then at weekly intervals 
# for eight weeks. The BPRS assesses the level of 18 symptom constructs 
# such as hostility, suspiciousness, hallucinations and grandiosity; 
# each of these is rated from one (not present) to seven (extremely severe). 
# The scale is used to evaluate patients suspected of having schizophrenia.
#
# RATS data is from a nutrition study conducted in three groups of rats
# by Crowder and Hand (1990). Crowder, M. J. and Hand, D. J. (1990). 
# Analysis of Repeated Measurements. Chapman and Hall, London. 
#
# The three groups were put on different diets, and each animalâ€™s body weight
# (grams) was recorded repeatedly (approximately weekly, except in week seven
# when two recordings were taken) over a 9-week period.
